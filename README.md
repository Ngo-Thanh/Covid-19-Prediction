# Introduction
The objective of this project is to study the COVID-19 outbreak using basic visualization techniques and regression. The active and closed cases were compared and the growth factor was calculated to observe the change in growth rate. Short term predictions were performed in order to study the impact and spread of the COVID-19 in coming days.

** Regression Methods used:**

- Linear regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Ridge regression
- Polynomial Ridge regression
- SVM
